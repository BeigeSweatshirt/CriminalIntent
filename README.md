An Android application for logging and reporting "office crimes" - a stolen red stapler, microwave caught on fire when reheating food, etc. CriminalIntent is based on Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. The main branch is the base app, challenge exercises are implemented in the branches.
